## Code for generating texforms used in Long, Konkle, Cohen, & Alvarez (2016) and Long, St√∂rmer, & Alvarez, (2017)
## Most of this code comes from another repository maintained by  Jeremy Freeman : https://github.com/freeman-lab/metamers

## The two main scripts in these folders should be relatively well annotated. Note that usually we run this code on a computer cluster rather than locally as it takes 8 hours to finish generating one image. However, the main goal of this script is to provide transparency on the procedures used to generate the input images to the algorithm, which were selected with some care.
